## Smart Contracts
We know contracts as a process where two or more parties are agreeing on some terms. If at least one of the parties fails to comply, this means the transaction will be cancelled. These contracts are legally binding and any party that breaks the terms that can be prosecuted by law.


Smart contracts make this process easier by facilitating, verifiying and enforcing the negotiations of the contracts. They are bound to the blockchain, which means that a smart contract will be carried through no matter what as soon as all parties have signed it. 

Smart contracts can be used to implement turing complete programming languages on the blockchain. The most-used platform is Ethereum.
