This feels both strange and wonderful at the same time. My first official Blog post. Well technically I have been blogging on and off for many years now, but I have never sticked to one of the Blog projects for quite a long time. 

What will you see here? As I never really had the motivation to stay blogging for an audience this will largely be used as a plattform to store information and to clear my thoughts. I want to do this in a public way to share what I have learned with other people. I will probably write about many different topics like Startups, Entrepreneurship, Futurism, Life Hacks, Technology, Programming and so on. 

I am strong believer that we should work towards more transparancy in many aspects of the world. This is why I decided to put the blog on github and Jekyll where everyone can see the history of the posts but also contribute to the articles if they want.
