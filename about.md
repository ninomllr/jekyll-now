Hi, my name is Nino!

I am an entrepreneur with a background in information technology. I believe that we have to tackle the big challenges that this world faces as communities. If we work together we will find solutions. This is why I am all about helping to bring people together and working in interdisciplinary groups on new projects. I am passionate about digitalisation, smart cities, international relations, communities as well as food, climbing and hiking - actually mountains and their nature in general.
